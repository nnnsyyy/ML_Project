This file contains several methods, which are described in their respective files.
The run.py file is a script than runs the model and reproduces the best results we had with the model in the results folder. 

Simply run it and some informations about the progress of the simulation will be printed into the terminal, and a cross_validation.png will be generated, showing the error on the testing and training data made by the cross_validation.

The method we were asked to implement, namely ridge_regression(y, tx, lambda_) is in the file ridge_regression, along with the other methods that help selecting the best parameters.
