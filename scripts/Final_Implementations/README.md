This folder contains the implementation of the 6 methods required in the project. Their implementations are all in the file implementations.py.

Each method has an associated helpers file (except for least squares), which contains the methods associated to it (e.g. compute_gradient, ...). There also are general helpers files, namely helpers.py and proj1_helpers.py, as well as build_poly.py, which constructs the polynomial basis and costs.py, which contains the cost functions we use. 

The run_implementations.py provides the ability to perform a basic test run for each of the 6 methods. The results folder contains contains the results for each test run of each method.
